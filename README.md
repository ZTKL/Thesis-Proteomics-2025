This repository contains code for the **Interactive Analysis Suite for Proteomic Data**, developed as a part of my Master's thesis *Deciphering the Heterogeneity in Plasma Proteomic Signatures to Reveal Breast Cancer Risk Phenotypes* at KTH in 2025. Earlier development versions were maintained in a private KTH Git repository; this public release contains the finalized scripts prepared for my Master’s thesis.

The suite is designed to provide a interactive workflow facilitating exploratory analysis, visualization and interpretation of proteomic datasets, with a focus on dimensionality reduction and clustering analysis.

## Features:
- **Interactive Workflow for exploratory analysis of Proteomics datasets**
- **Data Quality Control** - tools for handling raw proteomica data and preparing it for analysis.
- **Preprocessing** - Options for filtering, normalisation and adjustments (e.g. residualization).
- **Confounder Identification** - Options for identification of confounding variables including Surrogate Variable Analysis.
- **Stratification** - Identification of dominant trait groups and options for data stratification based on covariate information.
- **Parameter Optimization** - Options for optimization of parameters for included clustering algorithms.
- **Analysis** - Including cluster stability analysis, similarity analysis, correlation analysis, and differential abundance analysis.
- **Visualization** - options for visualization of obtained results.
